                        The solution was Reflection Cave, prepare for some mountaineering<br>
                        This was a connect-the letters puzzle, to create the name of a location using up all the letters!<br>
                        Unfortunately those who did not realize this at all and found the location by assuming its an anagram do not get any points as I decided this would be considered guessing the answer in this case.<br>
                        (Those who then still connected the letters correctly and provided an image have gotten full points)<br>

                    I've got some personal troubles myself, so perhaps we can help each other out.<br>
                    If you can give advice with the problem I'm facing, you can have my old equipment half off. A little worn, but still useable.<br><br>
                    You see, I'm the father of two wonderful daughters, and these cute little angels are very fond of the Pok√©mon Beautifly.<br>
                    Yesterday, I encountered a Bug Catcher who offered me a fantastic deal on a dozen Wurmple - naturally, I couldn't pass up such an opportunity!<br>
                    They did tell me only 9 out of these 12 will evolve into Silcoon, but thats alright, I also got some rare powder from them that could alter the evolutionary path of any Wurmple it is fed to!<br>

                    Could you please help me divide these Wurmples into two groups, and decide which one(s) to give the special feed to?<br>
                    I want to make sure both of my daughters can experience the joy of raising their Wurmples into Beautiflies the exact same number of times.<br>
                    If some Dustox end up in the mix, that's perfectly fine - but neither group can contain more Beautiflies than the other!</div>

                    This seemed to be a very difficult puzzle to most of you, but thats pertially on me for perhaps including a little too much flavour text...<br>
                    Therefore, let me give you all some hints and extend the deadline by another 24 hours.<br>
                    <br>
                    <hr>
                    <br>
                    So how knowledgeble is Mr. Rhyme really?<br>
                    At the very least, he is more knowledgeable than you are.<br>
                    There may be some very niche things you know that he doesn't, but you have no way of knowing what those may be.<br>
                    Does he know the encounter rates in Viridian Forest? Does he know how to use Fly? What about the president of the United States?<br>
                    Those are some really likely candidates to succeed, but in the end, they are all guesses - maybe he actually know how to Fly too just doesnt have any wings to do so!<br>
                    <br>
                    And how about that letter we just gotten? Well, he was reading a letter, which may or may not be that same one... Once again, just a guess!<br>
                    <br>
                    The solution to the puzzle is much more simple and straightforward.<br>
                    He does not yet know what you will answer to his question!<br>
                    Answer in a way that forces them to either give you the big sack of coins or go against the promises he told you!<br>

                <div>Hi! I'm a little confused on the goal of the puzzle.<br>
                <br>
                Do we need to give Mr. Rhyme new knowledge, or just identify something that he does not know?<br>
                <br>
                Also, in this hint is sounds like you're saying that "He does not yet know what you will answer to his question!", but Mr. Rhyme never gave us a question except for when he asked if we "see those two stashes of gold coins on my table?"-- is that what this is referring to? Or is he referring to the challenge he issued? (I realize this is a somewhat pedantic question, but, in the context of the solution for a riddle, that could be an important distinction, so I had to ask!)<br>
                <br>
                Also, does Mr. Rhyme have the ability to know the future and/or read a person's mind, or know what's behind him? If we can't assume that he doesn't know how to fly, then it also seems possible that we can't assume he doesn't have psychic abilities like that--but I could be overthinking this, so I had to ask!<br>
                <br>
                Sorry for all the questions, and thanks for making these riddles! I've been having a lot of fun with them so far :)</div>

                    <div>Still no correct solutions submitted!<br>
                    <br>
                    This puzzle was combination of true-false statements, truth-and-lies.<br>
                    Mr. Rhyme claimed he will decide which sack of coins to give you depending on your answer, so he does not yet know what you will be getting.<br>
                    He also claimed to give you nothing if you are lying.<br>
                    <br>
                    Under those terms, the correct answer is "You will not give me the small sack of coins".<br>
                    <br>
                    If this statement is false, you get nothing because you were lying. But if you get nothing the statement is actually correct! That leads to a contradiction.<br>
                    <br>
                    If the statement is correct, then he cannot give you the smaller sack, but it contains new information so he must give you something. Which means you are guaranteed to get the bigger sack of coins!<br>

                    Sadly, theres no way to distinguish the Wurmples. Most of you looked for visual queues‚Ä¶ We are not expert Bug Catchers so how are we really supposed to guess that?<br>
                    <br>
                    The correct answer is to divide the Wurmples into a group of 3 and 9 Wurmples (note its not specified they have to be of equal size) and use the powder on the bigger group group.<br>
                    <br>
                    This means that while we cannot predict how many Beautiflies end up in each group, they are guaranteed to be of the same amount! See table below:<br>

                <div>The image is used to visualize the situation explained in the text. You can solve most puzzles without relying on the image. But there are also a few visual puzzles like the first one was, where it plays a crucial role.</div>

                <div>The Wurmple puzzle also could have been visual depending on the wording.<br>
                It says "they are almost indistinguishable even to most experts" which is the cue that it isnt. You're not an expert.<br>
                If it was less strict, i.e. "I'm not sure which is which", then a visual solution would've been acceptable.<br>
