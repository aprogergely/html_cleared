                    <div>Puzzle 4 deadline is closed!<br>
                    This was a very popular puzzle with several correct solutions!<br>
                    You start with 679 leftovers.<br>
                    From those, you make 679/7 = 97 make candles and no leftovers remain<br>
                    However, once you sold them, the customers will bring back their leftovers again!<br>
                    So you can make another 97/7 = 13 candles and will have 6 leftovers remaining<br>
                    Then, they bring back 13 leftovers. Along with the previous 6, you have 19 leftovers, enough for 2 new candles and 5 leftovers remaining<br>
                    Finally, when they bring back those two candles, you will have a total of 7 leftovers, enough for one more final candle to be crafted.<br>
                    <br>
                    So the answer is, you can make 97+13+2+1=113 candles!<br>
                    <br>
                    As a sidenote, the same number can be reached by simply dividing 679/6 =113,<br>
                    but thats not always a logically correct way to solve the puzzle as it would return 6/6=1 if you only started with 6 leftovers.

                <div>Fair as in both of you following the rules set by the competition and any additional rules you may agree upon. They think of predeciding the looser and then sharing the prize as unfair.<br>
                <br>
                The image for the ships is meant to be accurate, however it was not measured so it could be off by a few cms. If you used a ruler to determine that the 3 boats on the image are not equidistant than thats just slight drawing error.</div>

                    Nobody liked the Hippos :(<br>
                    Got very few submissions, but unfortunately one of them was correct so no hints are given...<br>
                    This was a vague puzzle too where I might've accepted alternative solutions...<br>
                    Unfortunately not Dogparty's though, as it was stated in the puzzle that they don't wish to share the prize.<br>
                    <br>
                    The solution should be to simply swap Hippos (or tickets, whichever you find easier).<br>
                    By using eachother's Hippos, the consolation prize will actually go to the winner rather than the looser.<br>
                    <br>
                    As Elinthind pointed out, this does assume that both racers play fairly and do reach the goal though,<br>
                    so if somebody play unfairly, then the first person reaching the goal would still have to<br>
                    go back to drag their own Hippo to the goal as well.<br>
                    <br>
                    Also gives the "At least I tried" achievement to Kitty and Aquacorde for 3 consecutive incorrect answers.<br>
                    They technically got this yesterday but I forgot.

                <div>Hi! Looking for a bit of clarification on this question:<br>
                Do the travelers need to find a way to always have access to the lamp, or is simply having a candle fine?<br>
                Are the travelers fine with traveling at a slower pace?<br>
                Does the "only 2 people can pass at a time" mean that a candle can be shared between a maximum of two people? (I'm assuming so, but you know what they say about assumptions)<br>
                Is it alright if more than one "bunch" of people passes through the cave at once, if each group has their own candle? Assuming the first group is farther ahead than the second. And, if so, is there enough room in the cave for people to switch between groups?<br>
                <br>
                Or, does having one candle in the cave count as having the whole "cave" being lit, and only 2 people can be in the cave at one time?</div>
            </div>

                <div>They may not hold the candle in their hands as it is too hot, nor in any flammable material.<br>
                A traveler cannot move forward in darkness.<br>
                The lamp (candlelight) only provides enough light for two people at a time.<br>
                When people move as a group, they move at the pace of the slowest member of that group.</div>

                    We had many great submissions for this puzzle!<br>
                    <br>
                    As for the solution, 4 objects can only be of equal distance from eachother if they are placed into the corners of a pyramid shape.<br>
                    This means, that the last vehicle must be either above or below the sea level.<br>
                    Since it was specified that they are <i>in</i> the sea, the correct solution is a submarine!<br>
                    I'd like to congratulate to Venia Silente for deducting that it may be a <i>nuclear</i> submarine<br>
                    at that given that all vehicles are using a different power source.<br>
                    This was not a neccessary part of the solution though, and unfortunately have no way to give bonus points for it.

                    Traditionally, this puzzle is solved by having the travelers pass in groups of two,<br>
                    and somebody repeatedly coming back with the lamp to pick up another person.<br>
                    However, if you knew the puzzle, it was easy to get it wrongly,<br>
                    because this time it had a slight twist!<br>
                    <br>
                    The Psychic, as shown in the image, can levitate small objects the size of a candle.<br>
                    Assuming they can do so for 2 hours straight, two groups may try to pass simultaneously,<br>
                    and they'd only need 7 candles!

                    Solving the map was surprisingly simply, almost as if I sent the wrong image,<br>
                    regardless, all submissions turned out to be correct...<br>
                    I also forgot to specify that you cannot go around the cave, so while its not the intended solution,<br>
                    I'll have to accept that too. Nobody submitted both however, so the achievement for<br>
                    two correct solutions submitted remains unclaimed.<br>
                    <br>
                    Earlier, somebody asked what the symbol at the bottom is. I did not answer this question,<br>
                    because the puzzle provides enough details to figure it out and it is in fact a key part<br>
                    of the puzzle - even if it was trivial to most participants.<br>
                    To those who havent played the newer generation games: This is the in-game sprite of the<br>
                    Shalour Sable, a local delicacy sold only in Shalour City and is merely a symbol<br>
                    representing the settlement. You do not need to turn around and strat the map at the Tower of Mastery.<br>

                    Nearing the end of the GT I see motivation has dropped.<br>
                    This wasnt neccessarily a difficult puzzle, yet there were<br>
                    only 3 submissions, and nobody has submitted puzzle 10 yet!<br>
                    <br>
                    The letter in the puzzle represent a direction: Up, Down, Left, Right.<br>
                    Each button has to be pressed once, finishing with the middle button<br>
                    If you figured this out, you can simply add the number of steps<br>
                    that need to be taken in every direction:<br>
                    7 Left, 9 Right, 18 Down,17 Up<br>
                    So you need to start 2 steps to the left and 1 step up from the middle button.
