							<div>This seemed to be a very difficult puzzle to most of you, but thats partially on me for perhaps including a little too much flavour text...<br>
							Therefore, let me give you all some hints and extend the deadline by another 24 hours.<br>
							So how knowledgeable is Mr. Rhyme really?<br>
							At the very least, he is more knowledgeable than you are.<br>
							There may be some very niche things you know that he doesn't, but you have no way of knowing what those may be.<br>
							Does he know the encounter rates in Viridian Forest? Does he know how to fly? What about the president of the United States?<br>
							Those are some really likely candidates to succeed, but in the end, they are all guesses<br>
                             - maybe he actually know how to Fly too just doesn't have any wings to do so!<br>
							And how about that letter we just gotten? Well, he was reading a letter, which may or may not be that same one... Once again, just a guess!<br>
							The solution to the puzzle is much more simple and straightforward.<br>
							He does not yet know what you will answer to his question!<br>
							Answer in a way that forces them to either give you the big sack of coins or go against the promises he told you!<br></div>

							<div>Hi! I'm a little confused on the goal of the puzzle.<br>
							Do we need to give Mr. Rhyme new knowledge, or just identify something that he does not know?<br>
							Also, in this hint is sounds like you're saying that "He does not yet know what you will answer to his question!", but Mr. Rhyme never gave us a question except for when he asked if we "see those two stashes of gold coins on my table?"-- is that what this is referring to? Or is he referring to the challenge he issued? (I realize this is a somewhat pedantic question, but, in the context of the solution for a riddle, that could be an important distinction, so I had to ask!)<br>
							Also, does Mr. Rhyme have the ability to know the future and/or read a person's mind, or know what's behind him? If we can't assume that he doesn't know how to fly, then it also seems possible that we can't assume he doesn't have psychic abilities like that--but I could be overthinking this, so I had to ask!<br>
							Sorry for all the questions, and thanks for making these riddles! I've been having a lot of fun with them so far :)</div>

					<div class="result-box">
						<div>Still no correct solutions submitted!<br>
						This puzzle was combination of true-false statements, truth-and-lies.<br>
						Mr. Rhyme claimed he will decide which sack of coins to give you depending on your answer,<br>
						so he does not yet know what you will be getting.<br>
						He also claimed to give you nothing if you are lying.<br>
						Under those terms, the correct answer is "You will not give me the small sack of coins".<br>
						If this statement is false, you get nothing because you were lying.<br>
						But if you get nothing the statement is actually correct! That leads to a contradiction.<br>
						If the statement is correct, then he cannot give you the smaller sack, but it contains new information so he must give you something.<br>
                        Which means you are guaranteed to get the bigger sack of coins!<br>
						Awards 7500 points to 5qwerty who actually had the right idea from before the hint but couldn't quite get the answer working.<br>
						Also well done for Elinthind who almost got it right at the very last moment!<br></div>

						Sadly, there is no way to distinguish the caterpillars. Most of you looked for visual queues‚Ä¶<br>
                        We are not expert Bug Catchers so how are we really supposed to guess that?<br>
						The correct answer is to divide the caterpillars into a group of 3 and 9 (note its not specified they have to be of equal size)<br>
                        and use the powder on the bigger group group.<br>
						This means that while we cannot predict how many butterflies end up in each group, they are guaranteed to be of the same amount!<br>

						This was a very popular puzzle with several correct solutions!<br>
						You start with 679 leftovers.<br>
						From those, you make 679/7 = 97 make candles and no leftovers remain<br>
						However, once you sold them, the customers will bring back their leftovers again!<br>
						So you can make another 97/7 = 13 candles and will have 6 leftovers remaining<br>
						Then, they bring back 13 leftovers. Along with the previous 6, you have 19 leftovers, enough for 2 new candles and 5 leftovers remaining<br>
						Finally, when they bring back those two candles, you will have a total of 7 leftovers, enough for one more final candle to be crafted.<br>

						So the answer is, you can make 97+13+2+1=113 candles!<br>

						As a side note, the same number can be reached by noticing that if you burn a candle, only 6/7 of the candle is gone, the  rest will be recycled.<br>
						So from the 97 candles you made initially, you will be able to burn them 97 * 7/6 = 113 times in total.

							Do the travelers need to find a way to always have access to the lamp, or is simply having a candle fine?<br>

							Does the "only 2 people can pass at a time" mean that a candle can be shared between a maximum of two people? (I'm assuming so, but you know what they say about assumptions)<br>
							Is it alright if more than one "bunch" of people passes through the cave at once, if each group has their own candle? Assuming the first group is farther ahead than the second. And, if so, is there enough room in the cave for people to switch between groups?<br>

						As you both keep going in circles, the leash gets entangled onto the tree's trunk and gradually becomes shorter.<br>
						Eventually you get close enough to reach one of the further branches and grab a fruit without fully reaching the tree.</div>

							<div>You can submit them all.<br>
							In that case, only the last one will be considered for giving points, however if multiple were correct you may get an achievement.<br>
							Or you could submit them conditionally, i.e. "I'd Fly down the cliff if my character has wings, otherwise try to use Teleport",<br>

						<div>Puzzle 11 deadline is closed!<br>
						This was a tough one but also a puzzle with several different solutions.<br>
						I have received 3 submissions total:<br><br>

						Devalue thought of unbraiding the rope and remaking it into a slightly longer rope.<br>
						This is a tedious task that needs some crafting skill, but depending on the thickness of the original rope<br>
						(which wasn't specified) it could work and still be faster than going back to the cave.<br><br>

						Dogparty has come up with multiple creative solutions, in particular trying to climb down while holding<br>
						both ends of the rope in your hands and not tying it at all so you can pull it down once you get to the<br>
						resting point. However I cannot give points for those as they still require you to jump several meters down, which is too risky.<br>
						<center><img src="Descend_submission_1.png" alt="Descend_1" class="puzzle-image"></center>
						5qwerty's solution may be the safest option, placing a lit candle next to the rock, close to the rope,<br>
						so that it would light the rope on fire after some time once the candle gets shorter and release the knot, making the rope fall down.<br><br>

						The correct solution also uses the candle in a similar way. You tie the rope in such a way that a 20m and<br>
						a 10m half is dangling down. You climb down the 20m half and once you reach 10m, you light the 10m half on fire.<br>
						Once the fire reaches the top, the knot gets undone and the other 20m half of the rope falls down to you.<br>
